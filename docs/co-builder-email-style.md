# Co-Builder Email Style Guide

> Reference for drafting daily/weekly Co-Builder competition update emails.
> Tone: Professional but warm. Indonesian. A few emojis for visual anchoring.
> Keep paragraphs short. Use bold for key info. Tables for data.

## Voice & Tone
- **Approachable leader** — friendly but not overly casual
- First person ("Saya" atau "Tim IT"), not third person
- Acknowledge contributions by name — people love seeing their name
- Celebrate wins, but be honest about gaps
- Never shame — redirect with encouragement
- Use questions to engage ("Sudah coba fitur baru?")

## Structure Template

```
Subject: 📊 Co-Builder [Week/Day X]: [headline hook]

[1-2 sentence opener — energy, context, or gratitude]

```

## Emoji Usage
- Use sparingly — max 5-8 per email
- Section headers: 🏆 🔧 ✨ 💡 📢 🎯
- Inline: ✅ for done, ⚡ for quick wins, 🔥 for highlights
- Never in formal sentences or table data

## Do's & Don'ts

**Do:**
- Keep under 300 words (excluding tables)
- Name specific people for contributions
- Show before/after when scores change
- Give concrete examples (good bug report vs vague one)
- End with clear action item

**Don't:**
- List every technical detail (they don't need commit hashes)
- Repeat the same CTA from last email verbatim
- Use English jargon without context
- Send without proofreading (names, numbers)
- Mention Yuma or GLS-ERP topics to GIS-ERP team
